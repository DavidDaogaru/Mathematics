The **Yule-Kendall skewness statistic (resistant)**  
The Yule-Kendall statistic measures skewness in the middle half of the data (only). It does not consider the entire distribution.
The formula is as follows: $$\large{\dfrac{(q_{75}-q_{50})-(q_{50}-q_{25})}{q_{75}-q_{25}}}$$. The function is easily written as below.

```{r}
YK=function(x){ 
qs=quantile(x,probs=c(0.25,0.5,0.75))
res=(qs[1]-2*qs[2]+qs[3])/(qs[3]-qs[1]) 
names(res)=NULL 
res 
} 
```

The **moment skewness** considersthe entire distribution and is computed as follows: $$\large{\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\dfrac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s}\right)^3}$$
